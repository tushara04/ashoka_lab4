## Checklist for a Good Report: 

1. Timely Submission
2. Aims of the Experiment
3. Introduction and Theory
    1. Describe the theory
    2. Define new concepts
    3. Derive EVERY formula
    4. Define the variables used during derivations
    5. Put up figures that explain the theory
    6. Cite the figures using superscript linking to the reference section. Explain the figures properly in the caption.
    7. Cite definitions and ideas used by using superscripts.
    8. Show every step of the derivation
    9. Question why a formula is the way it is and explain that.
    10. Question and explain why assumptions or simplifications are made.
3. Methodology:
    1. Introduction (when the exp was done, how, etc.)
    2. Apparatus
    3. Procedure (describe for all the parts -- create subsections if needed). Past tense -- describe what YOU did.
4. Observations and Analysis:
    0. Mention the least count!!! 
    1. Don't give data but explain the data collected and obtained.
    2. Calculations (every step)
    3. Plot
        1. x and y axes error bars (standard deviation)
        2. Legends
        3. Units everywhere
        4. Caption: be descriptive. explain what you are seeing.
        5. Title
        6. Explain the plots
5. Error Analysis
    1. Propagation Error: error propagated in the final value because of the errors in the variables the function was dependent on. EVERY SINGLE VARIABLE.
    2. Relative Error: how much the obtained value differs from the actual value
6. Results 
    1. Significant errors
    2. Plot the average of different sets with error bars (std dev)
    3. Be descriptive.
    4. Explain the results.
    5. Present the final value with the errors. 
    6. Propagation error ~ Margin of Error.
    7. Relative error ~ separately mention.
7. Discussion: discuss. Super comprehensive.
    1. Describe the challenges faced during the experiment.
    2. Describe what went wrong and what went right.
    3. Describe the hypothesis and observations made.
    4. Describe the explanations obtained.
    5. Describe the novelty in the procedure you carried out.
8. Conclusion: conclude by explaining the aim, how the exp meets the aim, and the meeting of the aim by providing the results.
9. References
10. Appendix: link the github repo, describing what it contains (the code, the database); maybe talk about what was left earlier: calculations etc.

Tips: 
1. If many of anything provide average.
