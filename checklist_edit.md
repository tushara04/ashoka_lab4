- [ ] Timely Submission
- [ ] Aims of the Experiment
- [ ] Introduction and Theory
  - [ ] Describe the theory
  - [ ] Define new concepts
  - [ ] Derive EVERY formula
  - [ ] Define the variables used during derivations
  - [ ] Put up figures that explain the theory

  - [ ] Cite definitions and ideas used by using superscripts.
  - [ ] Show every step of the derivation
  - [ ] Question why a formula is the way it is and explain that
  - [ ] Question and explain why assumptions or simplifications are made
- [ ] Methodology
  - [ ] Introduction (when the experiment was done, how, etc.)
  - [ ] Apparatus
  - [ ] Procedure (describe for all parts — create subsections if needed). Past tense — describe what YOU did.
- [ ] Observations and Analysis
  - [ ] Mention the least count

    - [ ] Caption: be descriptive, explain what you are seeing
    - [ ] Title
    - [ ] Explain the plots
- [ ] Error Analysis
  - [ ] Propagation Error: error propagated in the final value because of the errors in the variables the function was dependent on. EVERY SINGLE VARIABLE.
  - [ ] Relative Error: how much the obtained value differs from the actual value
- [ ] Results
  - [ ] Significant errors
  - [ ] Plot the average of different sets with error bars (std dev)
  - [ ] Be descriptive
  - [ ] Explain the results
  - [ ] Present the final value with the errors
  - [ ] Propagation error ~ Margin of Error
  - [ ] Relative error ~ separately mention
